<h2>UBJsonReader on GWT doesn't deserialize many long values correctly.</h2>
<p>
The check should look like this, with the same values for a pair of `long` states when entered in, when serialized into JSON or UBJSON.
It is correct on LWJGL3:

<p>
However, on GWT it is not correct all once deserialized from UBJSON!

<p>
The reason for this is a mistake in DataInputStream's GWT implementation, which read an `int` and then tries to make it the low 32 bits of a `long`.
It does so incorrectly, using <pre>long b = readInt() & 0x0ffffffff;</pre>
(<a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/85588b826a47c09a33e0bc7d9d80ce95886ba64e/backends/gdx-backends-gwt/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/gwt/emu/java/io/DataInputStream.java#L88-L92">source here</a>).
This appears to assume the 32-bit to 64-bit promotion rules of C or C++, but Java does not do this, and current versions of IDEA and Android Studio will warn about the above code!

<p>
That code will read in a 32-bit signed int, mask it with an int (!) that is equivalent to -1 (this does nothing, and it remains an int), then store that in a long.
Storing an int in a long extends the sign bit from the most significant bit of an int to fill every bit in the upper half of a long, making a read-in int such as <pre>0x87654321</pre>
become the long <pre>0xFFFFFFFF87654321L</pre>. This is combined with an earlier int for the high bits using bitwise OR, but if the upper half is 0xFFFFFFFF, then the OR wipes out the earlier high bits.
The correct way is to use <pre>long b = readInt() & 0xFFFFFFFFL;</pre> instead.
